feat: Implement Ultimate Cinematic System, Stun/Fallback Mechanics, and VFX Fixes

## Major Features
- ✨ Cinematic ultimate camera zoom with charge shake (KOF/Street Fighter style)
- ✨ Stun system: 3-5 consecutive hits trigger 3s stun with break mechanic
- ✨ Ultimate fallback: Ultimate hits cause fall → ground → get up sequence
- ✨ Movement lock during 2.3s ultimate activation animation
- ✨ Ultimate hold/release flow: Animation → Idle → Throw on Q release/timeout

## Critical Fixes
- 🐛 Fixed Grudge's ultimate fire trail VFX not appearing (moved attachment to animation event path)
- 🐛 Fixed all character ultimate ball VFX trails (Echo energy, Nova multi-ball)
- 🐛 Fixed stun VFX rotation spawning incorrectly
- 🐛 Fixed stun animation continuing after stun break
- 🐛 Fixed AI ultimate activation before holding ball
- 🐛 Fixed AI ultimate effects not applying (separated AI/human systems)

## VFX Improvements
- 🎨 All ultimate ball trails working with proper attachment timing
- 🎨 Character-specific stun VFX with correct rotation
- 🎨 Proper VFX cleanup on player hit, ground bounce, and dodge
- 🎨 Camera shake during ultimate charge (2.3s continuous vibration)
- 🎨 P1/P2 camera rotation auto-mirroring for cinematic zoom

## Gameplay Changes
- 🎮 Players cannot catch/throw during stun or fallback
- 🎮 Trick/Treat abilities no longer require holding ball
- 🎮 Ultimate MUST be used with ball (enforced for human and AI)
- 🎮 Stun breaks immediately when stunned player is hit (fighting game style)
- 🎮 Movement disabled during ultimate activation for dramatic effect

## Technical
- Added stun/fallback animation parameters (IS_STUNNED, IS_FALLEN, STUN, FALL, GET_UP)
- Separated AI ultimate system (instant execution) from human (cinematic)
- Added ResetToIdle() for proper animation state cleanup
- Extensive debug logging for VFX attachment troubleshooting
- Camera zoom settings fully exposed in Inspector (distance, height, rotation, shake)

## Files Changed
- PlayerCharacter.cs - Ultimate flow, stun/fallback, VFX attachment
- CameraController.cs - Cinematic zoom, rotation mirroring, charge shake
- PlayerAnimationController.cs - Stun/fallback triggers, ResetToIdle()
- BallController.cs - DestroyAttachedVFX(), state transition cleanup
- CollisionDamageSystem.cs - VFX cleanup on hit, ultimate detection
- VFXManager.cs - AttachUltimateBallVFX() with extensive logging
- CatchSystem.cs - Stun/fallback catch prevention
- AIControllerBrain.cs - Ball requirement checks

## Documentation
- Created comprehensive guides for all systems
- Added Inspector setting references
- Documented testing procedures
