Final Evaluation Slides & Presentation
Guidelines of FYP 2
General Guidelines for Presentation
Here are guidelines covering the Presentation Process for your FYP II defense:

You will have 10 minutes to present and 3 minutes for question answers. Strictly adhere to
the time limit for your defense and divide your slides logically across the sections. Practice
the entire presentation aloud with a timer to ensure smooth pacing and avoid reading directly
from the slides.
Formal business attire is mandatory as it shows respect for the evaluation committee
and the occasion. For gentlemen, wear a suit or blazer and dress shirt; for ladies, wear a
suit, formal separates, or a tailored dress.
Speak clearly and confidently at a steady pace while maintaining consistent eye contact with
the committee members. Be prepared for the Q&A session, and if you don't know an answer,
politely state you need to revisit the data.
General Guidelines for All Slides
Before reviewing the slide-specific recommendations, please note that the following rules apply
to every slide in your presentation:

Every slide must have a page number placed at the bottom-right.
Use one consistent font family throughout the deck (Calibri, Segoe UI, Roboto, or Arial).
Font sizes must follow a readable hierarchy :
Title: 32–40 pt
Subheadings: 24–28 pt
Body text: 18–22 pt
Captions: 14–16 pt
You are allowed to use any template that suites your presentation. Maintain a consistent
colour theme and layout across all slides.
Ensure all images, icons, and diagrams are high-quality and properly aligned.
Keep all titles short, clear, and professional.
Basic requirements of the presentation are given below, yet you may add more slides per the
project need or according to the supervisor instructions.
